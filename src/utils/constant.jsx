    question: "What do I get in the report?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Each report provides a concise summary of the property’s title status, including:
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-5 my-2">
          <li>Current ownership</li>
          <li>A brief ownership history</li>
          <li>Liens, mortgages, and encumbrances on record</li>
          <li>
            Any issues that could affect the title (e.g., unreleased liens or easements)
          </li>
        </ul>
        You’ll also see visual elements such as timelines or parcel maps, making the
        information easy to understand at a glance. For complete transparency, <strong> all of the original documents collected during the
          search are provided with your report</strong>—including deeds, lien documents, and tax
          records—so you can always reference the official sources directly.
        
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the analysis?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Very accurate. Title Munke’s AI is trained to carefully read and cross-check
        official records, reducing the risk of human error and catching small
        inconsistencies that might otherwise be overlooked.
        Machine precision allows the system to be as reliable—often more so—than a
          manual search. If the AI encounters anything unclear, it flags it instead of guessing. The data
        comes directly from county and public records, ensuring your report is based on
        trustworthy sources.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I get results?",
    answer: (
      <>
        In most cases, you’ll have your report within minutes of submitting your request. For typical residential properties, turnaround is usually under 10 minutes. This is dramatically faster than traditional title searches, which can take days or even weeks. By automating the process and collecting every relevant document, Title Munke saves you time while ensuring nothing important is missed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is a Title Munke report legally reliable?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Title Munke reports are highly reliable for informing your decisions. We pull data directly from official and public records, and we provide all supporting documents alongside your summary. Our AI’s thoroughness means you’re likely getting a report that is more comprehensive and consistent than a quick manual search would be. That said, Title Munke is a research and analysis tool—it is not a legal certification or a title insurance policy. For closings, you would still obtain title insurance from a licensed company. Think of our report as your “homework” on the title: it gives you and your professionals a complete view of the property’s history and potential issues early on, helping you move forward with confidence.
      </>
    ),

  {
    question: "Who can benefit from Title Munke?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Title Munke is designed for anyone involved in a real estate transaction or
        property research, including:
        <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-5 my-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Homebuyers and Real Estate Investors:</strong> Get peace of mind about
            a property’s history before making an offer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Estate Agents and Brokers:</strong> Spot title issues early,
            resolve them proactively, and close deals faster with full transparency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attorneys and Legal Professionals:</strong> Save time on due diligence
            with complete reports and original source documents in one place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Title Officers and Professionals:</strong> Use Title Munke as a fast,
            reliable preliminary search tool to handle the heavy data-lifting while you
            focus on resolving complex issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
          In short, if you need to understand a property’s title quickly and clearly—with
          both a professional summary and the original documents—Title Munke is built for
          you.
